SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
Cleaning data: checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.

Joining tables: selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.

Descriptive Statistics: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions.

Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs): designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse.

Reporting results: a Powerpoint presentation with answers to key questions and recommendations.
